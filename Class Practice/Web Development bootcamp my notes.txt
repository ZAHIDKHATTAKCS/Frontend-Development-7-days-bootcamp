								HTML & CSS

			Day # 1
- Frontend refers to the process of creating the user interface
- basically three languages html,css and javascript
- Explore Extension (Auto Rename tag, Live Server(you don't have to refresh it again and again))

			Day # 2
- css (cascading style sheet) this is like a language through which we color our different elements in a website
- linking of css (inline css, internal css, external css)
- Selectors, selectors are used for select elements or tags to style, types of selectors (Tag selector, id selector and class selector)
- use of box model by going to inspect and check it out in the style tab in the bottom
- all elements are the two types like block level and inline level , Block level elements are those elements that takes full width of the screen and inline level elements are take only the width of its content
- layout (Flexbox and Grid) these are used for creating layouts
- Pseudo Selectors (all those properties that need a single colon ":" are called Pseudo class for example {:hover}, and all those properties that need double colon "::" are called Pseudo Elements for example {::after,::before})

- Animations (rotate animation on image by using @keyframes rotate {0%,100%} )
- Media Queries (@media screen and only(max-width:200px){background-color:blue;})


			 Day # 3
	JavaScript
- Javascript is used for add functionality in website
- Javascript linking(There are two ways of linking javascript, internal by script tag, and other is create a file of javascript.js and link it in your code by script tag with an attribute of src) best one is external script
- in javascript your errors, warnings will be shown in console tab in browser by some using some console functions like (console.log("to print something"), console.error("to show error in console in browser"), console.warn("to show warning
  in the browser))
- variables , there are three types of variables in Javascript (var, let, and const) the difference in between these three is (Const variable can't be redeclare once it is declare in program, while var can be changed mean can be 
   redefined once it defined in program like var num=3; num=23; , let is also can be redefine in program once it is define in program) the difference in between let and var varibales is "scope" var variable is global scope and
   let variable is block scope and another difference is let variable is used in modren javascript

- Datatypes in Javascript while we know that there are no datatypes in javascript but some are these like when you initilaze a variable with a string this will be string variable if you initilize a variable with a number it will be 
  considered int variable while if you initialize a variable with a float value it will be considered a float variable , so if we assign a ture false value to a variable it will be considered boolean variable. null datatype where 
  there is no data in the variable
- Array and object are mostly used in reactjs , while objects are the key value pair, we can also used array inside object, if you want to print specific thing in object you have to write like console.log(objectname.age) this will
  only print age from the object

- Operators, + , -, *, /, %
- Conditional statments (if , if else, if if else else)
- Functions is the set of instruction that is used to perform specific tasks, to define function in javascript you have to write function keyword at the start and than name and parameters if passes so, if you want to print the function
  values are want to run the function you have to call the function after declare, function is the set of code that you can call whenever you need in code.
- Loops are used for repeat the block of code, (for loop, while loop)
- string and arrays, String(Tolower case() , ToUpercase(), length, includes('p'),string.replace("1st string","to be replaced"))
- Arrays(array methods(array.pop(), array.push(), array[]='array2', array[0], array.length))

			Day # 4
- DOM (Document object Model) Manipulation, Dom is like when we visit a page dom make a tree of website like that we see it in inspect and than element tab, why we do dom manipulation, there are different methods in DOM (Get ElementById(), Get elementByClassName(), 
  GetEelementByTagName('p'), .innerText = 'something' to change the content of the inner HTML, color the content through JavaScript, Document.CreateElement('p')-> to create element, document.ContentText='This is paragraph' ->
  add content to the element that is recently created, appenedchild(p) -> appenedchild is used to insert the element into the html document that you created recently)
- Input in JavaScript ()
- Event Listeners -> Event listeners are basically the set of code that execute based on some events like click on button, hover on a content , scrooling of site is also eventlisteners ()
- Set interval -> Set interval is the function used to repeatedly run a block of code after specific intervals  & set timeout is the function to run a block of code after some delay like when specific amount of time spend than run it
- Async functions -> is the function , where we can say if a function take some time and impact other execution this will be time consuming, so for that we using asynchronous function which starts run and also 
  continue the execution of the remains code by adding await keyword.
- Arrow function new way of define functions
- Promise -> are a bit confusing and it is in the advance JavaScript
- Fetch API(Application programming interface) the service that used to take data from the external resources like weather , another city data , api creators are the backend developers
- local storage ->  ( The localStorage object allows you to save key/value pairs in the browser, The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date, different operations ->
  localStorage.setItem("loginInfo","Zahid");, console.log(localStorage.getItem("loginInfo")),localStorage.removeItem("loginInfo"); )
- Array advance ()

	
			 Day # 5
- React Js -> why any Framework, website will not reload when you used framework. Types of frameworks(Reactjs , angularjs, viewjs)
- Pre Requisite of ReactJs (install Nodejs) , Nodejs is used for backend but it is also used for frontend fro reactjs

- Creating Project(1. "npm create vite@latest" using cmd or vscode 2. "give your project name" 3. "select a framework like react in this case" 4. "select a language like javascript etc", project created)
  about news when user click on button he will be redirect to the news, to create project of react just simple create a folder and than go to path and write cmd there and hit enter after that cmd will be opened than simply just 
  write the command " npm create vite@latest " and hit enter than press "Y" and than "enter your project name" after that select your scripting language like "react" and hit enter and than select "JavaScript" 
  , npm is actually package manager ,

- what is npm (this is package maneger, project runner) like when we create a project there in project we will use external packages like a package of database data storing , vite (tool of build starter code)

- Folder Structure (package.json(hold information about what packages will be used in project while package is the set of predefine code that help us in our project), Readme.md file is for github, index.html is the html file, main.jsx is the file that show on frontend )

- How to run React Project (to run project we have to install packages in order to install packages we have to go to main directory and go to path and again open cmd and run command "npm install" this will create all the packages that will be used in react and now you can run your project by
  "npm run dev" this command is used to run your React Project)

 
- JSX (JavaScript XML (mean you can run javascript in html and html in javascript, its basicaly the structure, in reactjs we used components not classes),)

- Components (Class base component (old method), function base component), components in reactjs is the set of code that we create and we can reuse it again and again, ! most important

- Pops ( is like data that we give to the different components, like Title(heading) , description(paragraph) , cover(img)) ! most Important

- Hooks helps us to use react features in our projects (useState(is used for declare a variable and used for not reload the page), useEffect(the block of code run based on some condition while it will run once must, ))

- onclick

- React is the single page application mean page will not be reload


			Day # 6 
- Virtual DOM (Virtual DOM is like Dom in javascript, it a form of tree that show full structure of the site in inspact) and virtual DOM is the copy of original DOM , and it track that where is the changed happened and the channged components status will be changed the remains are remains same

- Input Events (onChange event, e.target.value(e holds many data in our case we only used for targeting the value that a user entering to the input field), in this we learn about how to handling the inputs by usestate and onchange)

- Fetch (we just fetch news api (NewsApi.org) and create an account and we will receive our api and than go to documentation of that website and "get curated breaking.." click on this and you will See "Get https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=API_KEY" so remove the Get and add your 
  own api provided by the website after create account and paste it just after = like (https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=381cf8b149194c9f96375c0eb200e009))

- Setup Tailwindcss (to integrate the tailwindcss with the react you have go to tailwindcss official website and than go for frameworks and select react than go to install tailwindcss mean part 2  1st part is skipped because 1 part is already done mean to creating react project we already create it , in
   part 2 there are commands we have to copy and just paste it in terminal first command will install the tailwindcss packages in our project you can check it out just simlpy go to package.json file)

- Conditional Rendering (is to run something/components based on certain condition)

- Routing (rounting is like to go to another page without reloading mean redirecting to another route , but ReactJs have no built-in route so for that we have to From(React router DOM got to this and click on quick start and than go for "npm i react-router-dom"
  and run this command in vscode so this will install React Router DOM packages in our project))

- Router (router is like a single page in website)
